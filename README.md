# Mason Loring Galusha – Portfolio (In Progress)

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site is under active development and will serve as the central hub for my **web projects** and future endeavors in **automation, AI, and full-stack development**.

---

## Current Focus

- **Portfolio Website**: Building a clean, modern showcase for my skills, background, and upcoming projects.
- **Grocery List App**: Designing a web application to manage grocery lists, track budgets, and eventually integrate real-time pricing and AI recommendations.

---

## Recent Projects

- **Basic To-Do List** (Beginner Project)
- **Valentine’s Day Themed App** (Small, fun project)

These helped me practice foundational web development skills. Now I’m moving on to more advanced and feature-rich applications.

---

## Coming Soon

- **Detailed Project Overviews**: As I complete each major project, I’ll add screenshots, live demos, and technical breakdowns.
- **Tech Stack & Tools**: Planning to explore **Node.js**, **React**, and possibly AI frameworks, but I’m keeping options open for now.
- **Backend & Databases**: Currently investigating the best approaches to handle user data, authentication, and real-time features.

## Stay Tuned

## I’ll be updating this portfolio over the next few weeks. Feel free to check back to see progress on my **Grocery List App** and other planned projects!

_Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more soon!_
